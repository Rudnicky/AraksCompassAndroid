        Application is fully free of charge. Compass may have problems inside
        buildings and basements. \nCallibration which is presented in the application
        is a common way \nto callibrate most of the devices. \nIf after these steps
        compass still not working in a proper way, probably \nthere is something
        wrong with your device sensors. \n\n\nThank you very much for downloading
        this application and enjoy.
